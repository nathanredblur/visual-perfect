# Storybook Addon Visual Perfect

Storybook addon for comprehensive visual testing, including:

1.  **Visual Regression Tests (Panel)**: Compare Storybook stories against baseline images to catch unintended UI changes.
2.  **Pixel Perfect Comparison (Tool)**: Overlay your Storybook story with a reference image to check for pixel-level accuracy (Coming Soon / To be detailed).

## Features (Visual Tests Panel)

- **Run Test**: Compares the current Storybook canvas with an existing baseline image. If no baseline exists, a new one is created. Image comparison uses the [Pixelmatch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pixelmatch) library.
- **Accept**: If visual differences are found, this action allows you to accept the new image as the baseline.
- **Redo**: Re-runs the visual test for the current story.

## Installation

First, install the package:

```sh
npm install --save-dev storybook-addon-visual-perfect
# or
yarn add --dev storybook-addon-visual-perfect
```

Then, register it as an addon in your `.storybook/main.js` or `.storybook/main.ts`:

```ts
// .storybook/main.ts

// Replace your-framework with the framework you are using (e.g., react-webpack5, vue3-vite)
import type { StorybookConfig } from "@storybook/your-framework";

const config: StorybookConfig = {
  // ...rest of config
  addons: [
    // Other addons
    "storybook-addon-visual-perfect", // ðŸ‘ˆ Register the addon here
  ],
};

export default config;
```

## Usage

### Visual Tests Panel

Once installed and registered, the "Visual tests" panel will be available in your Storybook UI.

1.  Navigate to a story.
2.  Open the "Visual tests" tab in the addons panel.
3.  Click "Run Test" to perform a visual comparison.
    - If it's the first time running the test for this story, a baseline image will be created.
    - If a baseline exists, the current story will be compared against it.
4.  If differences are detected:
    - Review the differences highlighted in the panel.
    - Click "Accept" to update the baseline image with the current version of the story.
5.  Click "Redo" to run the test again at any time.
